php-cgi.exe is an executable file associated with WampServer, a popular web development platform that allows users to create and manage web applications locally using Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Specifically, this file is part of the PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) component, facilitating the execution of PHP scripts in a CGI (Common Gateway Interface) environment. Version 7.3.5.0, published by Romain Bourdon, is generally considered safe for use when downloaded from the official WampServer distribution, but like any executable, it can potentially be targeted by malware or viruses if obtained from untrustworthy sources. Users may encounter errors related to php-cgi.exe, such as issues with script execution or configuration problems, often stemming from incorrect installation or conflicts with other software. To ensure safety, it is advisable to keep the software updated and to run regular antivirus scans, as well as to monitor system performance for any unusual behavior that may indicate a compromise.
