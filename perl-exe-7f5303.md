perl.exe is an executable file associated with ActivePerl, a distribution of the Perl programming language developed by ActiveState, specifically version 5.26.3.0. Generally, perl.exe is considered safe and is not classified as a virus or malware, as it is a legitimate component used for running Perl scripts and applications on Windows systems. However, like any executable file, it can be subject to security risks if downloaded from untrusted sources or if the system is compromised, potentially leading to errors or unexpected behavior. Users encountering issues with perl.exe, such as crashes or performance problems, may need to ensure that their ActivePerl installation is up to date or check for conflicts with other software. Regularly scanning the system with antivirus software can help mitigate any risks associated with this file and ensure its safe operation.
